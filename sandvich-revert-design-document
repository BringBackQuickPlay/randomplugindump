The scope of the revert is quite large, so need to organize my thoughts.

The goal with the sandvich revert is to revert it to a point where the following are true:

1. Sandvich can be thrown to gain health again.
2. Touching healthkits should give you a new sandvich (and delete any thrown sandviches that belong to the heavy who touched healthkit).
3. Touching resupply locker should give you a new sandvich (and delete any thrown sandviches that belong to the heavy who touched healthkit).

It's uneccesary to handle player death and spawn since the game does that for us.

Obligatory hooks:
CHealthKit so we can run code to give sandvich back.
Maybe hooks:
CTFLunchBox::SecondaryAttack

How can we track Sandvich?

is_sandvich in Entity enum

entities[entity].is_sandvich
bool used to check if a entity is a sandvich.

sandvich_owner_client in Entity Enum
entities[entity].sandvich_owner_client
int that entity has that corresponds to the index of it's owner.

previous_sandvich_ent in Players Enum
current_sandvich_ent in Players Enum

players[client].previous_sandvich_ent
Index of the previous sandvich (previous does not mean it's gone!).
players[client].current_sandvich_ent
Index of the current sandvich.


In post_inventory_application event:

Weapon = Entity index.
index = ItemDefinitionIndex.

Note: All checks will be sorrounded Feat_Heavylunchboxes and Wep_Sandvich and tf_weapon_lunchbox checks
and ItemDefIdx checks!

Start by doing

players[client].previous_sandvich_ent = players[client].current_sandvich_ent;
Then
players[client].current_sandvich_ent = weapon;

Check if there's a previous sandvich by reading previous_sandvich_ent
and checking if it's not -1 and if it's a valid entity.
If it is, then delete it (entirely with RemoveEntity) and set previous_sandvich_ent to -1

Then, 

Then JUST MAKE THE REVERT STOOPID!
And I did. Lol
